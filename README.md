PASSSPORTS is a sports-based mobile app designed to foster a community around sporting events. It allows fans to show their dedication to their teams of choice and provides them with a feed of information for previous and ongoing events. As it is community based, it includes features that allow a fan to interact with other like-minded fans of the same team. These features include marking them as an attendee for events and collecting digital autographs. Additionally, this app will expose sports fans to a different type of fitness: mental fitness. Included in the app are Mental Metrics tests, health and wellness tests that allow a user to test their mental toughness through a series of questions. Previously administered by hand, PASSSPORTS allows for self-administration of the tests and calculates the userâ€™s result in real-time. The calculated data will be put toward researching the relationship between mental fitness and physical performance.
